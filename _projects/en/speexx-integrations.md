This application is an "umbrella" Spring Boot application comprising several different integrations.

The goal of the __Workable integration__ is to provide customers that use [Workable](https://www.workable.com){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} as part of their recruitment process, with the tools to allow job candidates to take Speexx language assessments whose results can be seen later directly in the Workable platform by recruiters.

The __Microsoft Teams integration__ allows students that are already using [Microsoft Teams](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} in their organization, to gain access to Speexx training directly from inside the application.
